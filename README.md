# CE7454-final Project: Multifidelity-DeepONet for Data Center Thermal Prediction

Welcome to the repository of our CE7454-final project, where we delve into the implementation and evaluation of a cutting-edge Multifidelity-DeepONet model. This model integrates high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with real-time, low-fidelity sensor data to enhance thermal prediction accuracy in data centers. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the Multifidelity-DeepONet outperforms other baseline methods in predicting and managing thermal conditions within data centers.

## Project Overview

Data centers are crucial to modern digital infrastructure, requiring efficient thermal management for operational stability and hardware longevity. Accurate thermal prediction within these facilities is challenging due to complex layouts, varying operational loads, and environmental conditions. Our project aims to tackle these challenges by employing a Multifidelity-DeepONet, which combines high-fidelity and low-fidelity data sources for improved predictive accuracy.

### Key Features
- **Integration of Multifidelity Data**: Combines detailed CFD simulations (high-fidelity) and real-time sensor readings (low-fidelity) for comprehensive thermal mapping.
- **Advanced Modeling Techniques**: Utilizes Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) extended to handle multifidelity data, enhancing prediction capabilities.
- **Real-World Application**: Focuses on practical scenarios in data centers, addressing the need for effective thermal management.

### Experimentation and Results
We conducted various numerical experiments, including Poisson Equation and Reaction-Diffusion System simulations, to validate the efficacy of our model. The results highlight significant improvements in prediction accuracy over standard DeepONet models.
